This has the boards.txt, programmers.txt, and variants directory to support
the Atmel (Microchip) Xplained Pro ATmega4809 development board.  It's not
a "real" board add-on; instead it should be manually copied into an
official Arduino megaavr board-manager-installed directory:

	 cp -R * ...packages/arduino/hardware/megaavr/<version>/
